1.  Introduction

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED" "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Issues with DNAME

   List of issues and why DNAME is hard, reference DNSSEC, wild card,
   some other RFCs.

4.  Header that makes sense

   There are several ways DNS software may encounter a DNAME record,
   they are:

   1.  parsing the record in a [RFC1035] zone file.

   2.  parsing the wire format as described in [RFC2672] Section 3.

   When parsing a zone file and encountering a DNAME record, any
   confirming software MUST error on encountering the RR and refuse to
   load the zone.  If zone is DNSSEC signed, any RRSIG resource records
   covering a DNAME record MUST also lead to a refusal to load the zone.
   (TODO: we may not care about RRSIGs here).

   Parsing a DNAME record from the wire format it MUST be parsed as an
   unknown record as specified in [RFC3597].

5.  Special Processing

   All special processing as described in [RFC6672] is hereby obsoleted.

Internet-Draft               Obsolete DNAME                     May 2020


   If some DNS software parsing the record from the wire has a DNAME
   Resource Record in memory and responds to queries, direct queries for
   "TYPE39" will return the record.  This is in line with the [RFC3597]
   specification.
